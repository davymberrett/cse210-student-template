The meaning behind version control is that it allows a programmer to take checkpoints throughout their work. This is done by creating or saving specific versions, allowing the programmer to revert to previous states or apply changes.  The benefits of version control are that if a programmer wants to try something new without worrying about ruining the program, they can use version control to create a separate environment for testing. One application is that if two people are working on the same program, one can be editing and making changes while the other is designing or fixing bugs. One command used in version control is the branch command. This allows the user to make changes without affecting the original program.
